                <p>
                    We are group of users, whose MacBook Pro has a problem with random shutdowns which makes it unable to use.
                    This issue is permanent - it's not getting fixed neither with software updates or repair guides.
                    We all paid more than 2000 EUR for these laptops.
                    While buying these, we put our trust into Apple's hands - we believed that premium-priced products comes together with premium quality and appropriate customer support.
                </p>

                <p>Unfortunately, there are only unique cases where Apple offered at least paid repair - <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/help-updated-to-macos-10-12-4-mbp-randomly-shuts-off.2039446/page-2#post-24734183">for rest of the cases</a>, the laptops are diagnosed as "fully working".</p>

                <p>
                    In our opinion, Apple failed with solving this issue properly.
                    The repair requires to replace either <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Answers/View/357764/MBP+turns+off+Randomly+Without+Warning#comment315321">logic board or SSD</a>, which both costs 600 - 700 EUR and is covered with only 3 months warranty for that part.
                    The cause itself however was not found, it's still possible that problems will appear again because the diagnosis was incorrectly identified.
                </p>

                        Our MacBooks are randomly turning off during day.
                        It's hard to reproduce the problem for a first time, but when it happens the first, it's happening every 5 - 10 minutes.
                        When it happens, the laptop is turned off immediately, it just crash.
                        There is no pattern when it occures, it does not matter if it's heavily used or not (neither matter the temperature).
                    </p>
    
                    <p>
                        Sometimes, instead of immediate crash the screen and keyboard goes black, but the Apple logo is still on and the fans goes to a very high speed.
                        When this happens, the laptop does not turn off but is unusable and must be turned off manually.
                    </p>
    
                    <p>
                        In both cases we have tu wait ~5 minutes until it can be turned on again.
                        Once we turn it on, it usually crashes in few minutes again.
                    </p>
    
                    <p>
                        It takes a while (up to 8 hours) to make occure for a first time, but when it happens it's repeating immeadiately.
                    </p>
    
                    <p>
                        The problem occures mostly on MacBook Pro series manufactured in years 2013, 2014 and 2015.
                        There are many affected regions, posts about this problem comes from USA and several countries in EU.
                    </p>
    
                    <p>
                        We tried our best finding proper solution but we never found it.
                        We are convinced that it always was caused by insufficient diagnosis process.

                <p>
                    We demand appropriate attention to this problem and finding an actual cause.
                    We also demand a Free Repair Program for all MacBooks affected with this issue, without taking into consideration if it is under law-garanted warranty or extended Apple Care.
                    Why?
                    We already paid a lot of money for defective laptops and improper customer care.
                    We paid for diagnostics which did not found any issue, invested a lot time into communication with Apple or its Premium Resellers, we travelled abroad to visit nearest Apple Store in person, we lost our data.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Now it's your turn, Apple.
